1. Example 1 is for random NN with 5 layers and each layer 10 neurons. Run example.m to see the results. 

2. Example 2 is for robotic arm. Run example to see the results. 

3. Example 3 is for image recognition. The code is for verifying the safety of a randomly picked image with 3*3 perturbations.
